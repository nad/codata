module Lambda where

-- Syntax of an untyped 位-calculus.

import Lambda.Syntax

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Semantics based on substitutions

-- Substitutions.

import Lambda.Substitution

-- A big-step semantics for the language. Conditional coinduction is
-- used to avoid duplication of rules.
--
-- Cousot and Cousot give a similar definition in "Bi-inductive
-- structural semantics", and their definition inspired this one.
-- Their definition has almost the same rules, but these rules are
-- interpreted in the framework of bi-induction rather than the
-- framework of mixed induction and (conditional) coinduction.

import Lambda.Substitution.OneSemantics

-- Two separate semantics for the language, one for converging terms
-- and the other for diverging terms, as given by Leroy and Grall in
-- "Coinductive big-step operational semantics".
--
-- Leroy and Grall attempted to unify their two semantics into a
-- single one, using only coinduction, but failed to find a definition
-- which was equivalent to the two that they started with. However,
-- they aimed for a definition which did not have more rules than the
-- definition for converging terms; the definition in OneSemantics
-- does not satisfy this criterion.

import Lambda.Substitution.TwoSemantics

-- The two definitions are equivalent.

import Lambda.Substitution.Equivalence

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Virtual machine

-- A virtual machine with two semantics (one relational and one
-- functional), a compiler from the 位-calculus defined above into the
-- language of the virtual machine, and a proof showing that the two
-- semantics are equivalent.

import Lambda.VirtualMachine

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Semantics based on closures

-- A semantics for the untyped 位-calculus, based on closures and
-- environments. Leroy and Grall define a similar semantics but split
-- it up into several definitions, like in Lambda.TwoSemantics above.
--
-- The module also contains a proof which shows that the compiler in
-- Lambda.VirtualMachine preserves the semantics (assuming that the
-- virtual machine is deterministic). Leroy and Grall prove almost the
-- same thing. In their proof they use a relation indexed by a natural
-- number to work around limitations in Coq's productivity checker.
-- Agda has similar limitations, but I work around them using mixed
-- induction/coinduction, which in my opinion is more elegant. I am
-- not sure if my workaround would work in Coq, though.

import Lambda.Closure.Relational

-- A semantics for the untyped 位-calculus which uses the partiality
-- monad, along with another compiler correctness proof. An advantage
-- of formulating the semantics in this way is that it is very easy to
-- state compiler correctness.

import Lambda.Closure.Functional

-- The relational and functional semantics are equivalent.
